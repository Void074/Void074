### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Most of my projects are hosted on [here](https://bitbucket.org/void074/). But I will be also pushing a couple of my personal projects from BitBucket to Github. I am currently working the following:

- Sinatra Template, which I hope to turn into a Ruby gem called **Frank**, heavily inspired by Ruboy on Rails
- Tspace (Tmux Workspaces), another personal project for creating Tmux Worskspaces, inspired by Tmuxniator and VS Code Workspace
