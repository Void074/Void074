### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Most of my projects are hosted on [here](https://gitlab.com/void074). Currently redefining myself and my goals as I look into venturing into the SaaS or BasS space.
- [GuriaLabs](https://gurialabs.pages.dev/) - which is sitll a working in progress
- [GuriaLinux](https://gurialinux.netlify.app/), a personal project that is a work in progress

Most of the projects are for my own personal learning and sharing knowledge on what I learnt so far...

Currently still breaking into

- Netlify and Cloudflare
- JavaScript, NodeJS, PNPM, ReactJS, ExpressJS and Chakra UI
- MySQL, PostgreSQL and Cloudflare's D1, not for getting Neon
- Server Management and Task Automation with Bash and Perl

## Things on the fence

This are things that I am unable to make a decision on

- Rust
- Supabase
- Deno
